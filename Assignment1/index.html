            <p>Enrique Garduno was born in a country with beautiful beaches, architecture, and most importantly food. Beacuse who doesn't love food right? Enrique was born in Mexico City, the land that saw the birth of tacos al pastor, quesadillas, pozole and many more delicacies.</p>
            <p>At the age of 19 Enrique ventured into a distant land mainly known for its breakfast tacos, tex-mex food, live-music, and overall hipster vibe. That is right, Enrique ventured into the beautiful city of Austin, Texas; leaving the country he dearly loved to seek a higher level of education.</p>
            <p>In Austin, Enrique was able to not only perfect his English skills but acquire a new language as well (Chinese). He got the opprtunity to study abroad and work in Shanghai, China and train with some Shaolin Monks. In 2015, he acquired his B.A on International Relations with a focus in International Economics and minors in Asian Studies and Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin. After his graduation, he got a position with a startup as an Account Executive.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, he didn't really found his place there. Having a deep passion for technology and learning. Remembering that he once created a video game and a website with his friends at the age of 13 he realized that his heart belonged to the world of technology and cration. Therefore, he set on a new journey. He enrolled at the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp in order to pursue his dream of becoming a programmer. Welcome to this new adventure!</p>
